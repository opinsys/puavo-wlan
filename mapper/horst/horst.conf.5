.SH NAME
horst.conf \- configuration file for \fBhorst(1)\fP
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/horst.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fI/etc/horst.conf\fP is the default configuration file. The
configuration file consists of zero or more lines.  Each line must be
either \fBEMPTY\fP, \fBCOMMENT\fP or \fBOPTION\fP and must end with a
new line character ('\\n', ASCII 0xa).

\fBEMPTY\fP lines must have zero or more spaces (' ', ASCII 0x20).

\fBCOMMENT\fP lines must begin with a hash sign ('#', ASCII 0x23).

\fBOPTION\fP lines must be in the following form:

.RS
option[=value]
.RE

Options and their acceptable values are described below in section
\fBOPTIONS\fP.

Lines not matching the format described above will cause \fBhorst\fP
to exit with non-zero status.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP channel=CHANNEL_NUMBER
Set the initial channel number to which \fBhorst\fP tunes the radio
at startup.

.IP channel_dwell=MILLISECONDS
Set the time \fBhorst\fP scans each channel when channel_scan=1 is
defined.

.IP channel_scan
Make \fBhorst\fP change/scan channels automatically in ascending
numeric order.

.IP channel_scan_rounds=N
Set the number of rounds \fBhorst\fP scans the channel range when
channel_scan=1 is defined. When N is reached, \fBhorst\fP exits with
zero status. If N is a negative number, \fBhorst\fP scans the channel
range infinitely.

.IP channel_upper=CHANNEL_NUMBER
Set the highest channel \fBhorst\fP will change to when
channel_scan=1 is defined. When CHANNEL_NUMBER is reached, the next
channel will be 1.

.IP client=SERVER_ADDRESS
Run \fBhorst\fP in client mode and connect to a server running in
SERVER_ADDRESS.

.IP control_pipe=FILEPATH
Accept control commands on a named pipe.

.IP display_interval=MILLISECONDS
Set the refresh interval of the user interface display. This option
can be used to reduce CPU load by using longer intervals.

.IP display_view=history|essid|statistics|spectrum
Set the initial display view.

.IP filter_bssid=BSSID[,BSSID]...
Ignore all packets except packets belonging to BSSID.

.IP filter_mac=MAC_ADDRESS[,MAC_ADDRESS]...
Ignore all packets except packets originating from MAC_ADDRESS.

.IP filter_mode=MODE[,MODE]...
Ignore all packets/nodes except packets/nodes of mode MODE.

.IP filter_packet=PACKET_TYPE[,PACKET_TYPE]...
Ignore all packets except packets of type PACKET_TYPE.

.IP interface=INTERFACE_NAME
Set the wireless interface which \fBhorst\fP uses to monitor the
radio spectrum. If interface INTERFACE_NAME is not already in monitor
mode at startup, \fBhorst\fP first tries to put the interface in
monitor mode and if it fails, a temporary virtual monitor interface is
added and used instead. The name of the temporary virtual monitor
interface is in the form horst[0-9]+. The virtual interface created by
\fBhorst\fP is deleted at exit.

.IP mac_names=FILEPATH
The file containing a mapping from MAC addresses to host names. The
file can either be a dhcp.leases file from dnsmasq or contain mappings
in the form "MAC<space>name" (e.g.: "00:01:02:03:04:05 test") line by
line.

.IP node_timeout=SECONDS
Set the time after nodes will be removed if no frames have been
received from them.

.IP outfile=FILEPATH
Write information about each received packet to FILEPATH.

.IP port=PORT_NUMBER
Set the port \fBhorst\fP listens to when run in server mode or the
port which \fBhorst\fP connects to when run in client mode.

.IP quiet
\p Make \fBhorst\fP less verbose and suppress the user interface.

.IP receive_buffer=BYTES
Set the size of the receive buffer. This option can be used to tune
memory consumption and reduce packet loss under high load.

.IP server
\p Run \fBhorst\fP in server mode.
