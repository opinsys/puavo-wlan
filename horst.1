.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhorst\fP is a small, lightweight IEEE802.11 wireless LAN analyzer
with a text interface. Its basic function is similar to tcpdump,
Wireshark or Kismet, but it's much smaller and shows different,
aggregated information which is not easily available from other
tools. It is mainly targeted at debugging wireless LANs with a focus
on ad\-hoc (IBSS) mode in larger mesh networks. It can be useful to get
a quick overview of what's going on on all wireless LAN channels and
to identify problems.
.IP \[bu] 2
Shows signal values per station.
.IP \[bu] 2
Calculates channel utilization ("usage") by adding up the amount of time the
packets actually occupy the medium.
.IP \[bu] 2
"Spectrum Analyzer" shows signal levels and usage per channel.
.IP \[bu] 2
Text-based "graphical" packet history, with signal, packet type and physical
rate
.IP \[bu] 2
Shows all stations per ESSID and the live TSF per node as it is counting.
.IP \[bu] 2
Detects IBSS "splits" (same ESSID but different BSSID \- this is a common driver
problem).
.IP \[bu] 2
Statistics of packets/bytes per physical rate and per packet type.
.IP \[bu] 2
Has some support for mesh protocols (OLSR and batman).
.IP \[bu] 2
Can filter specific packet types, source MAC addresses or BSSIDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
Client/server support for monitoring on remote nodes.
.IP \[bu] 2
Can be controlled via a named pipe.

.TP
See MONITOR MODE below for more information about the network interface setup.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP

running in server mode (\-C) or writing to a file (\-o).
.TP
.BI \-D
Show lot's of debugging output, including a full package dump. Only available
when compiled with DEBUG=1.
.TP
.BI \-c\  configfile
Use configfile instead of the default "/etc/horst.conf".
.TP
.BI \-C\  channel

\fBhorst\fP as normal and pressing the button 's' (Spec); then 'c' (Chan)
and 'a' (Automatically change channel).

is properly classified. This option can be specified multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-B\  BSSID
Only show/include packets which belong to the given BSSID.


.SH TEXT USER INTERFACE

The ncurses-based text interface tries to display a lot of information, so it
may look confusing at first. Below we describe the different screens and
options.

.TP
Main screen

.RS

The initial (main) screen is split into three parts. The upper area shows a list
of aggregated "node" information, the most useful information about each sender
which was discovered, one per line:

.RS

.TP
.BI /
\p "Spinner" to show activity
.TP
.BI Pk
\p Percentage of this node's packets in relation to all received packets
.TP
.BI Re%
\p Percentage of retried frames of all frames this node sent
.TP
.BI Cha
\p Channel number
.TP
.BI Sig
\p Signal value (RSSI) in dBm
.TP
.BI RAT
\p Physical data rate
.TP
.BI TRANSMITTER
MAC address of sender
.TP
.BI MODE
\p Operating Mode (AP, AHD, PRB, STA, WDS), see "NAMES AND ABBREVIATIONS"
.TP
.BI ENCR
\p Encryption (WPA1, WPA2, WEP)
.TP
.BI ESSID
\p ESSID
.TP
.BI INFO
\p Additional info like "BATMAN", IP address...

.RE

The lower area shows a scrolling list of packets as they come in:

.RS

.TP
.BI Cha
\p Channel number
.TP
.BI Sig
\p Signal value (RSSI) in dBm
.TP
.BI RAT
\p Physical data rate
.TP
.BI TRANSMITTER
MAC address of sender
.TP
.BI BSSID
\p BSSID
.TP
.BI TYPE
\p Packet type, see "NAMES AND ABBREVIATIONS"
.TP
.BI INFO
\p Additional info like ESSID, TFS, IP address...

.RE

The lower right box shows bar graphs for:

.RS

.TP
.BI Signal
of last received packet in green
.TP
.BI bps
Bits per second of all received packets
.TP
.BI Usage
Percentage of channel use

.RE

The lower edge is the menu and status bar, it shows which keys to press for
other screens. The status shows ">" when \fBhorst\fP is running or "=" when it
is paused, then "F" when any kind of filter is active, the Channel, the monitor
interface in use and the time.

.RE

.TP
Pause ('p' or <space>)

Can be used to pause/resume \fBhorst\fP. When \fBhorst\fP is paused it will
loose packets received in the mean time.

.TP
Reset ('r')

Clears all history and aggregated statistical data.

.TP
History ('h')

The history screen scrolls from right to left and shows a bar for each packet
indicating the signal level. In the line below that, the packet type is
indicated by one character (See NAMES AND ABBREVIATIONS below) and the rough
physical data rate is indicated below that in blue.

.TP
ESSID ('e')

The ESSID screen groups information by ESSID and shows the mode (AP, IBSS), the
MAC address of the sender, the BSSID, the TSF, the beacon interval, the channel,
the signal, a "W" when encrytoion is used and the IP address if known.

.TP
Statistics ('a')

The statistics screen groups packets by physical rate and by packet type and
shows other kinds of aggregated and statistical information based on packets.

.TP
Spectrum Analyzer ('s')

The "poor mans spectrum analyzer" screen is only really useful when \fBhorst\fP
is started with the -s option or the "Automatically change channel" option is
selected in the "Chan" settings, or the config option channel_scan is set.

It shows the available channels horizontally and vertical bars for each channel:

.RS

.IP
\fBSignal\fP in green
.IP
\fBPhysical\fP rate in blue
.IP
\fBChannel\fP usage in orange/brown

.RE

By pressing the 'n' key, the display can be changed to show only the average
signal level on each channel and the last 4 digits of the MAC address of the
individual nodes at the level (height) they were received. This can give a quick
graphical overview of the distance of nodes.

.TP
Filters ('f')

This configuration dialog can be used to define the active filters.

.TP
Channel Settings ('c')

This configuration dialog can be used to change the channel changing behaviour
of \fBhorst\fP or to change to a different channel manually.

.TP
Sort ('o')

Only active in the main screen, can be used to sort the node list in the upper
area by Signal, Time, BSSID or Channel.

.SH MONITOR MODE

To capture and analyze 802.11 traffic, the interface needs to be in monitor
mode. You can either setup the interface manually beforehand or let \fBhorst\fP
setup it automatically at startup. Usually, root privileges are required to
modify an interface setup.

\fBhorst\fP should work with any wireleass LAN card and driver which supports
monitor mode, with either "prism2" or "radiotap" headers. This includes most
modern mac80211-based drivers.

If the interface is not in monitor mode at startup, \fBhorst\fP first tries to
put the interface in monitor mode. If it fails (for example when the interface
is already in use), a new virtual monitor interface (horst0) is added and used
instead. The virtual monitor interface is removed when \fBhorst\fP exits. Note
that changing the channel via a virtual monitor interface is not allowed by the
wireless driver, so options -C and -s do not work when virtual monitor interface
is used.

Examples of how to setup an interface manually:

.TP
Using iw:
.nf
iw wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor

or

sudo iw wlan1 set type monitor
sudo iw wlan1 set channel 6 

.fi

.TP
Using iwconfig:
.nf
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
iwconfig wlan0 channel 1
ifconfig wlan0 up
.fi

.TP
Using madwifi:
wlanconfig wlan0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor

.TP
Using hostap:
.nf
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
iwpriv wlan0 monitor_type 1
.fi

Signal values and ranges may differ between wireless drivers and versions.
